            ðŸš¨ OAUTH SECURITY REQUIREMENTS:
            â€¢ NEVER hardcode OAuth credentials in config files
            â€¢ Use HTTPS for all callback URLs in production
            â€¢ Validate redirect URIs to prevent attacks
            â€¢ Store client secrets as environment variables only
            â€¢ Regularly rotate OAuth credentials
            â€¢ Monitor for unauthorized access attempts
