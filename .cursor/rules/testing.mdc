# Testing Standards

- Tests should be in a package structure matching the code (e.g., tests/validator/ for src/mxcp/validator/). Test data should go under tests/fixtures/validator/
- Use descriptive test names that match the functionality being tested
- NO example usage files - all code should be either tests or production code
- Use `uv run pytest` to run tests (not just `pytest`)
- Don't always create new test suites; check first if the new tests should be added to existing test suites
