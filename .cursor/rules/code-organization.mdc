# Code Organization

- Avoid code duplication - use inheritance or composition when classes share common fields
- Keep related functionality together in modules

# File Organization

- JSON schema files should be kept in a schemas/ subdirectory within the module
- Configuration files should use YAML format
- NO example files anywhere - not in tests, not in fixtures, nowhere
