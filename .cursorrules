# MXCP-specific development rules

## Development
- Do not create "backward compatibility" support in the code unless explicitely asked; this is a new s/w stack being used and it has no users yet, so backward compat is not a concern

## Documentation
- Use pydoc (docstrings) for documentation, not README.md files
- Module-level docstrings may include code examples if they add clarity
- No standalone example files - examples belong in docstrings only

## Dependencies
- Use existing dependencies where possible (e.g., pandas, numpy are already available)
- Avoid adding new dependencies without clear justification
- Remember to add dependencies to pyproject.toml as needed, under the corresponding component

## Tests
- Tests should be in a package structure matching the code (e.g., tests/validator/ for src/mxcp/validator/). Test data should go under tests/fixtures/validator/
- Use descriptive test names that match the functionality being tested
- NO example usage files - all code should be either tests or production code
- Use `uv` to run pytest
- Don't always create new test suites; check first if the new tests should be added to existing test suites

## Code Organization
- Avoid code duplication - use inheritance or composition when classes share common fields
- Keep related functionality together in modules

## File Organization
- JSON schema files should be kept in a schemas/ subdirectory within the module
- Configuration files should use YAML format
- NO example files anywhere - not in tests, not in fixtures, nowhere
