tool:
  name: "soql"
  description: "Use this tool when you need to query specific fields from a single Salesforce object, similar to SQL. It's ideal for getting structured data like 'all accounts in New York' or 'all contacts for a specific account'. SOQL is more precise than search or SOSL because you specify exactly which fields you want. For example, use this when you need to get a list of accounts with their phone numbers and addresses, or when you need to find all opportunities over a certain amount. If you need to search across multiple objects or don't know the exact field names, use the search or sosl tools instead."
  parameters:
    - name: query
      type: string
      description: "The SOQL query to execute. The query should follow SOQL syntax: SELECT field1, field2 FROM object_type [WHERE conditions] [ORDER BY field] [LIMIT n]. For example: 'SELECT Id, Name, Phone FROM Account WHERE BillingCity = 'New York' LIMIT 10'"
      examples:
        - "SELECT Id, Name FROM Account"
        - "SELECT Id, Name, Email FROM Contact WHERE AccountId = '001xx000003DIloAAG'"
        - "SELECT Id, Name, Amount, StageName FROM Opportunity WHERE IsWon = true ORDER BY Amount DESC LIMIT 5"
