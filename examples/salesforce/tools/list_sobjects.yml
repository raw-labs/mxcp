  description: "Use this tool to get a list of all Salesforce object names available in your org. This is essential for exploring your Salesforce instance and understanding what data you can access. The tool returns a simple list of object names (e.g., ['Account', 'Contact', 'Opportunity']). Use this before using other tools to ensure you're using valid object names. For example, use this to find custom objects in your org or to verify the exact spelling of standard objects. If you need detailed information about a specific object's structure, use the describe_sobject tool instead."
