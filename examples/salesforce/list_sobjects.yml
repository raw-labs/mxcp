The tool returns a simple list of object names (e.g., ['Account', 'Contact', 'Opportunity']). Use this before using other tools to ensure you're using valid object names. For example, use this to find custom objects in your org or to verify the exact spelling of standard objects. If you need detailed information about a specific object's structure, use the describe_sobject tool instead."
